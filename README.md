# Product-Review-Text-Classification

Getting started...

Before downloading the attatched jupytr notebook file, make sure Anaconda Navigator Tool is installed in your system.

To open the file, you must launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator, which must already be installed on your computer. To read the dataset from the code, make sure to modify the path variable. For instance, data = pd.read csv(r'C:UsersRachana SandaDownloads) in my code. Product Review Large Data.csv is the file name for it. The path 'C: Users Rachana Sanda Downloads' needs to be changed. Product Review Large Data.csv is the filename followed by the place where the dataset was obtained.

Install all the required libraries in the Anaconda terminal.

Then follow the code and run all cells. Post execution you can see the respective outputs for the each individual cells.
